## My Objective
1. usually we set a measure to the similarity between objects, such as cosine, Mahalanobis, etc. but we have no idea if which is the best choice, or if neither of there measures if suitable. we expect if there is an unsupersized method, which could take advantage of the data itself, with information theory, like entropy, to learn some latent variables for similarity measure.

## Paper Formalization
1. problem setting in the paper is, giving pairwise heterogeneous data, learn mappings for both data sets, so that the distance between mapped embbedings can be inferenced, and the label should be 1(pair) and 0(non-pair).

## Paper solution
1. mapping matrixs

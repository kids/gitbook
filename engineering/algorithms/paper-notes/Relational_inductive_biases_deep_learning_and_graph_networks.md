Relational inductive biases deep learning and graph networks[link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01261.pdf)

## My Objective
1. have a look at relational NN structure and training.

## Paper Formalization
1. a summary and generalization

## Paper solution
1. exponential need of sample: share network (no good)
2. list a few realized implementations:
-   Interaction Networks (Battaglia et al., 2016; Watters et al., 2017) and the Neural Physics Engine
Chang et al. (2017) 
-   Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks (GGS-NN) (Li et al., 2016)
-   CommNet (Sukhbaatar et al., 2016)
-   The single-headed self-attention (SA) (Vaswani et al., 2017)
-   Graph Attention Networks (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018)

## My Thoughts
1. intuitive and beautiful, however no better realization than expected.

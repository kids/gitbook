# DECADE\_A\_Deep\_Metric\_Learning\_Model\_for\_Multivariate\_Time\_Series

[link](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~liu32/milets17/paper/MiLeTS17_paper_8.pdf)

## My Objective

1. find elegent measure for multi-dimension time series similarity.

## Paper Formalization

1. made by Yan LIU's team
2. end-2-end

## Paper solution

1. embedding multidimension at each time step to same dimension, for a local distance measure
2. calc expectation of total distance via all possible alignment of two time series

## My Thoughts

1. most important point to me though is how to train the embedding network \(end2end\).
